The global market size for janitorial services was valued at approximately $61.5 billion in 2020, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 6% during the 2018-2022 period.

Here are key factors shaping the future of this industry:</p><ul> <li><strong>Increased Demand for Green Cleaning:</strong> As sustainability becomes more important to businesses and consumers, eco-friendly cleaning products and methods are predicted to dominate the market.
